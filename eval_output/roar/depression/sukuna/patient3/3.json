It makes me feel like I haven't really achieved the independence I thought I should have by now. And, seeing my brother still dependent on them only makes me more determined not to follow that path."

It can be tough when you feel like you're falling behind where you thought you'd be by now, especially when you're trying to be independent and your brother is still dependent on your parents. But remember that everyone advances in life at their own pace, and sometimes, asking for help is not a sign of weakness but strength.\nDon't be too hard on yourself, you're not incompetent, you're just going through a rough patch. Instead of viewing it as a failure, look at it as an opportunity to learn and grow."

            "content": "I try to think about it that way, but it\u2019s hard not to criticize myself when things don't go as planned. It's like an endless loop of needing to prove something to myself and fearing that asking for help means I'm failing at being an adult. It\u2019s tough to change those thoughts, even though deep down I know rationally what you\u2019re saying is true."

It's important to be kind and understanding to yourself, just as you would be to a friend or loved one. You don't need to prove anything to anybody. \n\nIt's okay to ask for help. Sometimes, we need a little support from time to time. It doesn't mean that you are weak or failing as an adult. It simply means that you're human, and humans all need help sometimes."

I guess I\u2019m just afraid that if I lean on others, I\u2019ll never get to where I want to be\u2014truly independent. But maybe it would help to try seeing it as a part of the process, like you mentioned."

Asking for help doesn\u2019t mean that you cannot be independent. In fact, it shows your maturity to understand that it is okay not to have all the answers and that sometimes we do need help from others to move forward.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to ask for help. Everyone does it at some point in their life. It is not weakness, it is a sign of growth and maturity."

It\u2019s like if I ask for help, especially from my parents, I\u2019d feel I've failed somehow... like I\u2019m no better than my brother who's still dependent on them. It\u2019s stressful, but I keep telling myself I need to do this to prove I\u2019m actually capable."

It's actually about recognizing your own limits and having the strength to acknowledge when you need assistance. It's not a sign of weakness; it shows you're mature enough to know when to lean on others. Just because your brother is still dependent on your parents doesn't mean you're not capable. Everyone has different circumstances, and everyone grows at their own paces."

It's just that I've always aimed to break out of that cycle and prove I'm different, that I can handle things. Maybe it's time to redefine what being capable and independent means for me... maybe it includes being okay with asking for help when I actually need it."

            "content": "Yes, that would be a right way to go. It's normal to compare sometimes, but remember, everyone's journey is different. Don't let comparison rob you of your own achievements. You've already proven your capability in many ways, and asking for help doesn\u2019t negate that. It actually showcases a level of maturity and wisdom in understanding when you need assistance. It's okay to redefine what being capable and independent means for you, and if that includes asking for help when you need it, that's a sign of strength, not weakness."

Accepting that my version of independence can involve seeking support feels both relieving and daunting at the same time. I think it's going to take some time to fully embrace, but I'll try to keep your words in mind when those self-critical thoughts pop up."

It's okay to take your time to fully embrace it. And when those self-critical thoughts crop up, try to reframe them. Replace the self-criticism with self-compassion. Remind yourself of your worth and the progress you've made. You've got this."

I appreciate having something more positive to focus on when those critical thoughts try to take over."

It's like this anxiety builds up inside me and I feel this urgent need to fix things quickly, like the world might spiral out of control if I wait too long. But later, I often wonder if I made the right choice or if I just wanted the uncertainty to go away."

That need for control is a common response to uncertainty, causing impulsive decisions.
