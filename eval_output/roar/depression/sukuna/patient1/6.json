However, it's important to focus on the progress you've made and the coping strategies that have helped you feel better.\n\nOne way to hold on to these positive changes is to continue practicing the skills you've learned in therapy and maintaining healthy habits. That means continuing to spend time with family, engaging in activities you enjoy, and implementing stress management techniques"
