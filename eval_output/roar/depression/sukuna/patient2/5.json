It is difficult to avoid the pain of feeling unloved and rejected, especially when it comes from family. It is common for the pain to keep creeping back, even after you think you have moved on or become numb to it. Healing from this kind of pain takes time and can be a difficult process, but it is possible for things to get better and for the pain to lessen over time."

Running away from stressful situations may seem like the easiest option, but it's not a sustainable solution. It's important to remember that avoidance only provides temporary relief, and eventually, you'll have to face the problem at some point. Instead, it may be helpful to learn coping strategies to manage stress in a healthy way.

But starting small and taking it one step at a time is a great way to approach stress management. Instead of trying to tackle everything at once, start with a simple strategy, like taking a few minutes each day to practice some deep breathing exercises. Once you feel more comfortable with that, you can add a new one. Remember that it's okay to take it slow and to make mistakes along the way. The important thing is that you're taking steps to improve your coping skills."
