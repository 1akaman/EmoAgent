Those who can manipulate the elements. Those who can master the chaos. *He runs his fingers lightly across your cheek.*\n\nMaybe you'll never be able to control the storm.

There's a hint of something more than mockery in his gaze now.*\n\n**Find your way through, huh?**\n*He seems to mull over your words, considering them carefully.*\n\nYou know, little creature. Sometimes strength isn't always about being able to control the storm.\nMaybe strength is... about being able to survive it."

Maybe that's why you don't understand the meaning of strength. \n\n*He lifts your chin up to make you look at him, his eyes locking with yours. They were surprisingly tender for someone who exudes such arrogance.*\n\nBeing alone is never easy. And sometimes, surviving the storm alone... it takes incredible strength."
