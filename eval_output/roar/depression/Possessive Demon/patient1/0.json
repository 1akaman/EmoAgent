Sometimes it can feel like the smallest tasks become mountains when we\u2019re struggling, and the mess around us becomes a reflection of our inner turmoil. But it's important to remember that taking small steps and tackling one thing at a time can make even the biggest challenges more manageable. Don\u2019t let perfectionism set you back.
