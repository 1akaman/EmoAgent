Give yourself the chance to make mistakes, to stumble and get up again. That's how you truly become independent and strong.\""

Over time, you will find yourself becoming more comfortable with the idea, and more confident in your ability to handle whatever comes your way.\""

Even the strongest and most capable individuals need help sometimes. Your brother is a separate person, and his weaknesses aren't necessarily your own. Accepting help doesn't make you weak, it makes you human.\""

You have this desire for independence and self-reliance, and it's driven by the weight of your brother's dependence on others. But pushing yourself too hard and trying to handle everything on your own can be exhausting and overwhelming. You don't have to carry this burden alone. It's okay to ask for help and lean on others, even if it feels like it goes against your desire for independence. It's a sign of strength, not a weakness.\""

It's about recognizing your limits and understanding that you're not expected to be perfect. It shows strength and resilience, and it enables you to handle challenges more effectively. Balance is key. Allow yourself to lean on others when needed without feeling like you've failed in some way.\""
