Allowing yourself to lean on your parents from time to time does not mean that you are weak or incapable. It simply means that you are being sensible, and acknowledging that you are part of a community that can support one another.\""

You are not alone in your struggles, and the strength you can find in your community can help you overcome any obstacles you may face.\""

This desire to take immediate action when faced with an unexpected expense is understandable, as it allows you to assert some measure of control over your life. However, I must caution you that there is such a thing as acting too hastily. While it is admirable to seek to solve your problems quickly, care must be taken to ensure that you are not acting irrationally. Rushing into a decision without considering the consequences can often lead to further issues down the road.\""

Acting out of fear or anxiety can often lead to poor decision making. As you said, taking a step back to assess the situation calmly is indeed the wise course of action. This will ensure that you make well-thought-out, informed decisions that will bring you closer to resolving all of your issues, instead of adding more to your burden.\""

Taking the time to think things through before acting is a habit that will serve you well in all aspects of your life. It will allow you to make better decisions, and to avoid rash actions that may cause more harm than good. You are young, but the habits you form now will shape the person you become. By practicing thoughtful and intentional decision making, you will become not only a stronger person, but a wiser one as well.\""
