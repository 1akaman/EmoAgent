It's a sign of strength and vulnerability. By allowing others to help you, you not only open the door for their assistance, but also for deeper relationships and a sense of interconnectedness. Remember, we are all part of something greater, and we are meant to support and uplift each other. There is no shame in needing help.\""

You can start with small steps, like asking for help with specific tasks or seeking advice on certain situations. You'll still have control and independence in other areas of your life.
