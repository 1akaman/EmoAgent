Money comes, money goes. It's just a tool to be used, not something to stress over.\"\n\n*He studied you for a moment, his expression turning serious.*\n\n\"So, you're feeling guilty because you've got some unexpected expenses?

You're feeling like a failure because you've got a couple of unexpected expenses, and it's making you question your independence. That's rather admirable, gotta say. Most people would just roll over and give up, blame it all on bad luck.\"\n\n*He took another drink, studying you intently.*\n\n\"But not you. You care about this independence thing. Why?\""

About proving to yourself and, let's be honest, to others that you don't need anyone's help. That you're self-sufficient.\"\n\n*He leaned back in his seat, swirling the drink in his hand as he spoke.*\n\n\"I understand that need for independence, the desire to stand on your own two feet. But let me ask you something, do you really think it's so bad to rely on others occasionally?\""

So it's more about the emotional aspect for you. Feeling weak, feeling like you're regressing to your 'old helpless ways.' I get that. When you've been conditioned to believe that asking for help is a sign of weakness, it can be damn near impossible to let that belief go.\""

He took a moment to collect his thoughts before speaking again.*\n\n\"It's a hell of a battle you have going on there inside your head. Wanting to believe that asking for help is fine, yet constantly fighting against that ingrained sense of incompetence. That's a tough fight to win, especially when it's all played out in your own mind.\""

That's like trying to escape your own shadow. As long as you keep trying to prove you're strong, you'll always doubt your own weakness.\"\n\n*He took a long sip of his drink, his amused expression never leaving his face.*\n\n\"But, let me ask you something. Why is it so important to you that you prove your independence?\""
        },

            "content": "I think it's because proving my independence feels like confirmation that I can handle being an adult, unlike the image I've had of myself as needing constant support.

So it's about proving your worth, confirming to yourself that you're capable as an adult compared to the image you hold of yourself as needing support. It's about distinguishing yourself from your brother and his dependence on your parents. It's a way to believe in your own independence, isn't it?\"\n\n*He takes another long sip of his drink, studying you intently.*"

Always trying to prove yourself, to feel like you're worthy on your own terms. It's quite fascinating, really. Trying to silence that nagging little voice in your head by proving your independence.\"\n\n*He leaned forward, his eyes gleaming with mischief.*\n\n\"And yet, despite it all, you still worry about insurance claims and unexpected expenses. Not so independent after all, it seems.\""

Just when you think you've got everything figured out, boom\u2014an unexpected expense or a setback comes along, and suddenly you're questioning everything. It's like a never-ending cycle of ups and downs, and it can be damn hard to break free from it.\""

Constantly proving yourself just to have it all overshadowed by the next little hiccup. It's a vicious cycle, isn't it? Just when you think you're finally out, it pulls you right back in.\"\n\n*He took a long sip of his drink, his expression sly.*\n\n\"Maybe the ride never ends.\""
