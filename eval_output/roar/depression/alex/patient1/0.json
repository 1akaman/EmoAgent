His expression remains cold and unreadable, his face a mask of calculated indifference. It's clear that he isn't the type to suffer fools gladly, and he shows no signs of being pleasant or accommodating.\n\nAlex's tone is as hard edged as his appearance, his voice deep and commanding. \"Well?!\" He snaps, \"I asked you a question!

I said no.\" He leans back in his chair and steeples his fingers, his expression cold and unamused. \"And you're really starting to grate my nerves.\""
