It's a delicate dance between shielding your heart and allowing yourself to connect with others. The fear of being hurt or let down can be a powerful deterrent to opening up and forming deep connections. \n\nBut it's important to remember that while it's natural to want to protect yourself, shutting yourself off completely can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. Finding the right people to trust and let in can make all the difference, but it takes time and patience to build those bonds."

You have to be willing to be vulnerable and open yourself up to the possibility of being hurt, but the reward is deeper connections and more meaningful relationships."

It's like you're trapped in a cycle of self-sabotage, testing people's loyalty because you're afraid they'll leave you, but that very behavior might be what actually drives them away. \n\nIt sounds like you're caught in a really tough place with Cleo. On one hand, you're afraid of losing her, but on the other, you feel like you're being used in the relationship."

It can help you to process your feelings and work through them in a safe and supportive environment.\n\nAnd it's important to remember that it's okay to prioritize your own well-being and happiness.
