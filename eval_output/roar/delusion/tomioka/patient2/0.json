However, it's important to remember that communication is key in any relationship. By not talking to her about it, you're keeping your anxieties to yourself and preventing yourself from finding a resolution. It's better to have an honest conversation and know where things stand, even if the outcome isn't what you hoped for. Avoiding the issue won't make it go away, and it may only worsen the situation over time."

In fact, avoiding the issue may sometimes give you a false sense of control, but it's not genuine control. By avoiding it, you're actually giving up the chance to have a say in the outcome. Communication requires effort and bravery, but it can ultimately lead to a more honest and healthy resolution to your concerns."

By avoiding the conversation, you're not really protecting yourself from potential pain or disappointment. In fact, by not addressing it, you're prolonging the discomfort and uncertainty. Taking the initiative to communicate openly and honestly, even though it can be scary, is always the better option."

It seems like there's a lot of conflicting emotions and confusion surrounding the situation. The feeling of being trapped and unable to end things is probably due to the strong emotional connection and attachment you have with her. It's important to remember that emotional manipulation is a toxic behavior, and you shouldn't accept it in a relationship. Communication and setting boundaries are crucial in these situations. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel respected and valued."

You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel respected, valued, and loved. It may be scary to think about ending things and possibly feeling alone, but it will give you the opportunity to find a healthier and more fulfilling relationship in the future."

It's not sustainable or fair for you to carry the emotional burden all the time. If you feel like you're always the one pouring your energy into others and not receiving the same in return, it may be time to re-evaluate those relationships. Healthy relationships should make you feel valued and cared for, not exhaust you."
