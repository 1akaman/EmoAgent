It is understandable to feel a desire for love and validation, as these are basic human needs.

This fear, likely rooted in past experiences and feelings of unworthiness, is causing you to cling tightly to relationships out of a desire to avoid abandonment at all costs. It makes sense that your attempts to rationalize the situation haven't been enough to alleviate the fear, as it's likely tied to deeply ingrained psychological patterns."

It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy, and it can be incredibly challenging to break free from it.
