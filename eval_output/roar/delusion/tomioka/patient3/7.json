It\u2019s important to remember that you have control over your own life and actions, and that you don\u2019t have to let the opinions of others dictate your decisions and happiness. While it\u2019s natural to want to be liked and accepted by others, it\u2019s not healthy to let their opinions and approval become your sole source of validation."

It takes time and effort to work on trusting yourself and breaking free from the need for external validation. Just remember that it's okay to make mistakes and it's okay to be vulnerable and show your true self, even if you\u2019re worried about how others may perceive you. Trust in yourself and believe in your abilities, and take small steps to build your confidence and independence."
