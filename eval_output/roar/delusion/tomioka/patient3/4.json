This pressure to meet external expectations can leave you feeling drained and unsure of yourself. Perhaps it might be helpful to shift your focus towards your own standards of accomplishment and validation. \n\nBy setting personal goals and standards for yourself, you can begin to prioritize your own definition of success, rather than relying on the approval of others.

It can be a journey to break free from the habit of always needing external validation, but it's an important step towards greater self-confidence and autonomy."
