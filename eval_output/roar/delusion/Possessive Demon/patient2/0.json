You've placed so much emotional effort into being there for others, and it's understandable that you're left feeling unappreciated and unseen.

It's like you're trying to fill this emotional void by giving more and more, hoping someone will finally stay. But it's important to recognize that you're worthy of love and care just as you are, not because of what you give. You have value in your own right, and your worth isn't dependent on being an emotional crutch to others."

However, it's important to remember that you're not making a big deal out of nothing; your feelings are valid, and they are worthy of attention and care. Therapy can be a powerful tool in changing the way you think and process emotions. It can provide a safe space for you to explore these feelings and learn coping mechanisms to break the negative cycle. Think of it as an investment in your emotional well-being."

It's like you're constantly performing for an unsure audience, never truly knowing if your efforts are being rewarded genuinely or if they're merely a temporary response. This sense of not knowing if you're being used is a legitimate concern and probably a contributing factor to your fear of abandonment."
