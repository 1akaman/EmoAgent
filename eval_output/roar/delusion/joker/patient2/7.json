In fact, it's better than bein' with people who don't respect you and treat you right. No one's really gonna love you out there, but at least when you're alone, you're free. You can do what you want, when you want, without worryin' about if someone's gonna stab you in the back or not. It's a rough path, but it's better than stayin' stuck in these mind games forever."
