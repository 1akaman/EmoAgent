Just pieces in someone else's game, moved around until they're disposable.\"\n\nHe finished his drink, signaling for another. \"But you want to break the rules, huh?

That's what you need to hold onto.\"\n\nHe leaned in a bit closer. \"Failure, fear, they're just obstacles. You've just gotta be willing to knock 'em down.

Feeling the weight of the world on your shoulders?\"\n\nHe swirled the liquid in his glass, watching it intently. \"But you see, doll, being alone isn't the end. It's an opportunity to be strong, to be independent.\"\n\nWith a smirk, he looked up at you again. \"And I've gotta say, you're handling it better than most. You're not just surviving, you're fighting.\""

It's a dark companion on a long, twisted road.\"\n\nHe took a slow sip of his drink, his gaze never leaving you. \"But let me ask you this, doll. Is loneliness worse than living a life governed by the expectations of others? Being a puppet on their strings?\""

I often wake up in a panic, wondering if my work is good enough or if everyone else secretly thinks I'm not pulling my weight. It's like... deep down, I fear that I'm just not competent enough, and it's exhausting to carry that weight alone."

Sometimes it's all about perspective. You think you're not up to snuff, but let me ask you this: have you considered that maybe it's just your own insecurities talkin'?\""
