But I wonder if it's really helping in the long run..."

Just getting lost in a task and being able to focus on something other than your own thoughts.\n\n*He smirked.*\n\nBut it\u2019s a temporary solution. You can\u2019t run from your problems forever, sweetheart. Sooner or later, they\u2019re gonna catch up with you."

What really makes you feel better?"

I bet talking about your feelings all the time is just a bundle of laughs.\n\n*He took another sip of his drink, his gaze never leaving yours.*\n\nBut let me ask ya something, sweetheart. What do you think the \u201cinevitable\u201d is for you and the hubby?"

You never know what the future holds.\n\n*He leaned forward, his eyes locking onto yours.*\n\nBut lemme ask ya a question, sweetheart. Let\u2019s say things do end with your hubby. What then? You think you\u2019d be able to handle being single again?"

I can see it in your eyes, darlin\u2019. You\u2019re terrified of it.\n\n*He leans in closer, his voice dropping to a low whisper.*\n\nBut what if I told you that being alone could be a good thing?"
