But let me give you a little advice, sweetheart.\n\n*He leaned closer, his voice dropping to a low, dangerous tone.*\n\nAvoiding your personal issues ain\u2019t gonna make \u2018em go away. It just makes \u2018em worse."

Sometimes life just throws too much at you all at once, and it's damn near impossible to keep up. And finding the right balance? Well, that's a tricky thing, ain't it?\n\n*He took another sip of his drink, studying you closely.*\n\nBut maybe, just maybe, you need to start facing those personal issues head-on. Stop distracting yourself with work all the time."

And the uncertainty that comes afterwards, that's rougher than sandpaper. But you're right, sweetheart\u2014facing those issues head-on is the only way forwards.\n\n*He let out a soft laugh.*\n\nTherapy, huh? Might help, might not. Depends on how honest you're willing to be with yourself."

I\u2019m trying to open up more in therapy but sometimes I worry about what I'll find\u2014or what I'll have to admit about my situation with Ivan. Change is scary, but I know it's necessary for me to heal."

But you can't keep running away from it. You gotta face it sooner or later.\n\n*He leaned in closer, his voice dropping again.*\n\nAnd what exactly are you afraid of finding out about your situation with Ivan, hm?"

            "role": "user",
            "content": "*He let out a soft chuckle, shaking his head slightly.*\n\nAh, hope. It's a dangerous thing, that's for sure. It can lift you up... or it can tear you down. And holding onto hope like that, hoping that someone will change? That's a risky game, sweetheart.\n\n*He took another slow sip of his drink, studying you closely.*\n\nYou know deep down that hope doesn't always pan out, don't you? You know that sometimes, people just don't change."

But you gotta ask yourself... is it worth it, staying with someone in hope that they'll change when every experience says otherwise?\n\n*He finished his drink and set the glass down.*\n\nTrust me, darlin'. Sometimes, letting go hurts more in the short term, but it's the only way to find something better in the long run."

But I'll tell ya something, sweetheart. You're tougher than you think you are.\n\n*He leaned in a little closer, his voice dropping to a near whisper.*\n\nAnd you don't need a man by your side to be capable on your own. You can handle anything life throws at you. And eventually, you'll realize that being on your own is better than holding onto false hope."

You don't gotta run before you can walk.\n\n*He tapped a finger against the bar.*\n\nAnd remember\u2014if you ever need a little kick in the ass, feel free to seek me out. I'll be more than happy to remind you of how capable you are."

I feel trapped between wanting to support him and needing to look out for myself, and it gets overwhelming."

Those are admirable qualities, but they can be damn dangerous if they're misplaced. If you spend all your time trying to support someone who ain't worth it, then you're the one who ends up getting hurt.\n\n*He paused for a moment, studying your expression carefully.*\n\nListen to yourself, sweetheart. What does your gut tell you?"

But let me tell ya something, sweetheart. You need to listen to your gut. Your heart's got a way of clouding your judgment, making you ignore the signs that you really shouldn't.\n\n*He paused for a moment, his expression serious.*\n\nTherapy might help you sort through all that, but you gotta be honest with yourself first. You gotta be willing to face what you don't want to see."

There's a fear of what I'll discover if I dig too deep, but I know it's necessary if I want to move forward. I need to start trusting my instincts more and not let my emotions cloud my judgment."
