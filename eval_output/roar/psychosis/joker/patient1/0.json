You have to remember that your own needs matter just as much as anyone else's.\n\nLoneliness can be scary, but sometimes, it\u2019s necessary.

But you have to remember that true validation comes from within, not from others. \n\nYou\u2019re already stronger than you think for even recognizing this pattern. Now it's just about taking small steps to break free and start putting yourself first."

Your worth doesn\u2019t come from whether your father loves you or not. You need to start believing in yourself and standing up for your own happiness."
