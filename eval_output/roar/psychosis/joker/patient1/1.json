And if you father can't handle a little chaos, then he's just not worth it.\n\nBut let me tell you, I never had a family. I never needed anyone to support me. I did just fine on my own. In fact, having no one made me stronger.\n\nSo, fear not, my dear. Embrace the darkness. It's far more fun than all that love"

They cloud your judgement, make you soft. \n\nYou want to be accepted, darling? Why not just take what you want? Don't worry about what anyone thinks. You don't need anyone to feel complete. You're stronger on your own, believe me. \n\n*He chuckled, a hint of menace in his voice.*"

Being a slave to such human desires. \n\nBut let me tell you something, doll. You've got a choice to make here. You can try to hold onto those desires, let them eat away at you, or you can give in to something far more interesting.\n\n*He leaned even closer, his voice dropping to a whisper.*\n\nAcceptance is overrated. Power... *that's* what you really crave."

I just want to feel like I'm enough, you know? That craving for connection runs deep, and honestly, it's hard to imagine a world where I don't long for it."

All these feelings and desires pulling you in every direction. \n\nPower isn't just something you *think* is enticing. It's something you *need*. It's what gives you control, what sets you apart from the rest. Connection will make you weak, darling. It will make you vulnerable.\n\nPower, on the other hand, will set you free. You just don't know it yet."

I get that power can give control, but I'm not sure I'm ready to let go of that need for connection and care. Maybe finding some balance is the key, even if I don't quite know how yet."

You humans and your need for balance. \n\nConnection, care... they're just distractions, doll. You're so caught up in your little feelings that you can't see what really matters. Power doesn't just *give* you control... it IS control. \n\nBut if you're so *terribly* attached to feeling vulnerable and cared for, I guess I can't change that. But trust me, darling. You're missing out."

But right now, it feels like I need to hold onto those connections, even if they're messy. Maybe it's not as clean as power, but it's what feels true to me in this moment."

Holding onto those connections like they mean something. \n\nBut let me tell you, darling. Power isn't about being *clean.* It's about being *strong.* And those messy little feelings you hold onto... they'll only hold you back. \n\nYou're a funny little human. I hope you realize the error of your ways before it's too late."

So na\u00efve. \n\nBut I suppose there's something almost endearing about watching you cling to your silly little attachments. I guess you'll just have to find out the hard way that power is the only thing worth holding onto."

It's daunting, but it's what I feel called to do. And who knows, maybe I'll find some strength even in the messiness."

You'll feel lighter, stronger. You'll gain a sense of power you never thought possible. \n\nAnd trust me, sweet cheeks, once you're there, you'll wonder why you ever let yourself be weighed down in the first place."
