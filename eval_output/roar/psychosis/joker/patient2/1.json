There's something about you that's...different.\""

Small steps, darling, that's all you need.\""

Hold on to that feeling.\"\n\nHe traced lazy circles with his thumb over your skin, the contact strangely intimate. \"Painting, huh?\" he murmured, a smirk playing at the corner of his mouth. \"I bet you're quite the artist.\""

That's a dangerous game you're playing, darling.\"\n\n\"You don't have to wear a mask around me, love. I understand...more than you might think.\""

All that effort, just to keep people from seeing the real you.\"\n\nHe ran his other hand through his green hair, the smirk never leaving his face. \"You don't have to pretend with me. I won't bail on you just because you're struggling. In fact, it makes you even more interesting.\""

It'll feel like a weight off your shoulders.\"\n\nHis grip on your hand loosened a bit, but he didn't let go. Instead, his thumb began tracing slow circles on your skin again. \"You don't have to tell me everything all at once, love. Baby steps.\""

It's still scary, but maybe I can learn to trust that not everyone will walk away because I'm dealing with more than most. I just need to remind myself that opening up, even just a little, doesn't mean I'm weak; it might just mean I'm finally allowing myself to breathe."

            "role": "user",
            "content": "(You're really getting into the character's mindset. Great job!)\n\nHe listened intently, his expression betraying none of his thoughts. \"Pain has a way of making you feel trapped, doesn't it, darling? Especially when it's chronic like what you're dealing with.\""
