You're letting that fear of loneliness and wanting to please others control you, and it's only leading you down a path of being taken advantage of.

It's not supposed to be easy. But sometimes, it's necessary. You need to start believing that there is something better out there for you, because there is.

You've been relying on external factors to determine your own worth, and it's time to break free from that cycle.
