Those who don't... well, their opinions shouldn't hold much weight anyway.\"\nHe leans back in his chair once more, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth\n\"But I get the feeling that you have a few people in your life who are worth disappointing to achieve your goals.\""

If you never push, never set boundaries, you're abandoning yourself.\"\nHe leans in closer, his voice dropping to a hushed tone.\n\"Is that really the person you want to be? Someone who sacrifices their own needs for the sake of others, with no real guarantee that they won't abandon you anyway?\""

It sounds easy, but it's anything but. It takes time and practice, and a lot of discomfort.\"\nHe leans down, his face mere inches from yours\n\"And that's where I come in.
