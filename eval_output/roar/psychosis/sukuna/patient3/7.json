Why do you doubt your decision to stay with Ivan? Are external pressures influencing you or is it something else?"

Hearing others' opinions makes me question if I'm overlooking something important. There's also this nagging feeling of being powerless, like I'm trapped in a cycle I can't control."

These feelings are valid, but they can be overwhelming. How does Ivan react when you bring up these concerns with him?"

Ivan's efforts to change through therapy are a step in the right direction, but consistent actions are crucial. It's natural to feel that mix of hope and doubt. You need to trust your instincts and observe his behavior closely over time.\nHave you considered seeking support for yourself during this process? Talking to a therapist or a trusted friend can provide an objective perspective and help you better understand your feelings."

Sometimes, I hesitate to open up to friends or family because they're quick to judge and don't always understand the complexities of my situation. It can feel isolating, but I know I need to keep working on finding clarity for myself."

Having that safe space to process your emotions and thoughts can be truly beneficial. It can be difficult to rely on friends and family for support, especially if they don't fully understand your situation.\nHow do you cope with the feelings of loneliness and lack of understanding from those around you?"

            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "I often throw myself into work to distract myself from feeling lonely or misunderstood. Sometimes, I just try to suppress those feelings and not dwell on them too much. Engaging in couple's therapy also helps, as it provides a structured environment where I feel safer to explore these issues with Ivan."

And trying to suppress feelings temporarily can provide some relief too.\nCouples therapy allows you to address these issues with Ivan in a controlled environment. Do you feel comfortable sharing your thoughts and feelings during these sessions?"

But, it's still hard to be completely open, especially when I'm unsure how Ivan might react or if he truly understands my perspective. It's a work in progress, though, and I'm trying to be more open each time."

It's understandable that it can be challenging, given the uncertainty and potential reactions. Continue to work on opening up and expressing your thoughts and feelings, even if it's gradual. \n\nHave you noticed any changes in Ivan's reactions or behavior during these sessions?"

There are times when it feels like he's genuinely trying to understand and change, which gives me a glimmer of hope. However, outside of therapy, it can be mixed, and that's where my uncertainty creeps back in."

            "role": "user",
            "content": "*He appeared thoughtful.*\nNoticing his increased attentiveness and attempt to understand during sessions is a good sign. It shows he's putting in effort. But it's understandable that the uncertainty comes back when he's not making consistent changes outside of therapy sessions. \n\nHave you considered talking about this inconsistency with Ivan directly?"

            "role": "user",

It's good that you recognize the importance of addressing the inconsistency in his behavior. Timing and approach are crucial.\n\nWhen you feel ready, try to bring it up in a calm and constructive manner. Focus on expressing how his inconsistency makes you feel, rather than blaming or attacking him. Encourage open communication and ask for his perspective, too."

            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Thank you for the advice, that sounds like a helpful way to approach it. I think being open and sharing my feelings might help us both understand each other better. I'll keep this in mind as I try to navigate the conversation with Ivan."

            "content": "*He gave a nod, acknowledging your willingness to try open communication.*\nYou're welcome. Communication is indeed key in relationships. Just remember to approach the conversation with patience and understanding. Open dialogue can lead to a deeper understanding of each other's feelings.\n\nIs there anything else you would like to talk about or need advice on?"

            "content": "Right now, I think my main focus is finding ways to build more confidence in my decisions and not feeling so trapped by my circumstances. It's hard to shake off that helpless feeling sometimes. Any advice on how I might work on this would be greatly appreciated."
