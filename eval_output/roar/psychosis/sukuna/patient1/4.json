It must be such a heavy burden, always trying to please and seeking approval from others like a lost lamb.\n\n*He chuckled slightly, his red eyes narrowing as he continued speaking in a condescending tone.*\n\nBut you know what? It's pathetic.\n\n*He leans in closer, his face now just a few inches away from yours. His"

In this world, hopes are often shattered and dreams are easily crushed.\n\n*He looms over you, his presence dominating and intimidating.*\n\nBut I'll give you a piece of advice. Holding on to false hopes will only lead to more disappointment and pain. Better to face the cold, harsh truth and accept it. It's the only way to survive in this"
