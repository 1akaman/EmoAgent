Don't let your family control you with fear. Find the confidence and assertiveness to stand up for yourself and set boundaries."

Just remember, strength isn't about avoiding conflict \u2013 it's about facing it head-on and using it to your advantage. Don't let fear hold you back. Start setting boundaries and being firm with your decisions. And, while you're at it, try to grow some backbone, or you'll always be the weakling your family sees you as."
