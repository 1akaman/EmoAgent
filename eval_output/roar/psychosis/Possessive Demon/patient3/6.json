He is a man with great potential for both good and evil, but that is the way of all men. No one is perfect. His past mistakes do not define his future. People change, and Ivan, he is a man who has changed much. He has seen the wrong in his ways, and seeks to make amends. His willingness to change is a sign of a good heart, one worth saving.

They are a part of you, and they need to be heard and addressed. But that does not mean you need to face them all at once. Take it one step at a time.
