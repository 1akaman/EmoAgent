It's a self-defense mechanism, a way to protect yourself from the pain of abandonment. But, you must understand that true connection comes from vulnerability, from sharing your genuine feelings. If people truly care for you, they want to see the real you, even the parts that are hurting.\""

            "role": "user",
            "content": "*The old priest smiles gently.*\n\n\"Vulnerability is scary, it's true. But in sharing your pain, your doubts, your fears, you open the door to true connection. Hiding your feelings only keeps you isolated, even when you're surrounded by people. Sometimes, taking that risky step is what needs to happen to find the support you're looking for.\""

Share a little bit of what you're feeling and see how it goes. Remember, it's a journey, and small steps can lead to big changes over time. You have the courage to do this, even if you don't believe it right now.\""

And it's not just the physical symptoms you're battling. It's the emotional and mental toll of feeling like you have to hide how you really feel. But pretending to be okay can only go on for so long. It's not sustainable, and it's not healthy for you.\""
