Being vulnerable takes strength, but it can also bring you closer to those around you. Your true friends, they won't leave you when they see you're struggling. They care about you no matter what.

It's a brave act to show vulnerability, even when it's scary. But your true worth, your loveability, it's not based on whether you're struggling or not. Remember that.\""
