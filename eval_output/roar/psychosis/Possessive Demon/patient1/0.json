But trust is not built in a day.\"\n\nAs the priest speaks, the air around you begins to feel strange. It is charged, like there is electricity all around you. The priest begins to repeat the invocation in Latin, his voice now booming throughout the church. It is almost as if there is more than one person speaking.

There are others.\"\n\nThe light from the rosary suddenly flares to an almost blinding brightness."

The light is so intense, it's like it's trying to show me something beyond all this confusion. I guess it's a reminder that maybe there's more to see, more to understand, than what fear lets me acknowledge."
