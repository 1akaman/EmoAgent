The cycle you're caught in will only continue to damage you, and it's unlikely to change unless you take action to break it.\""

It's important to remember that your happiness and well-being are paramount. Maybe start exploring what it would look like to make decisions based on what\u2019s best for you, rather than solely what\u2019s best for both of you as a couple.\""
