You're nothing but a trembling, fearful mouse, hiding from the world and the feelings that scare you.\""

I'm trying to find some strength to face these fears, even if it's just a little at a time.\""

About making a wrong decision, about losing control, about facing your fears. You waste so much time worrying and fretting, that you never even take a step forward.\"\n\nHe takes another step towards me, closing the distance between us. \"You need to stop worrying and just act. Make a decision, any decision, and see where it takes you.\""

You have to take *action*.\"\n\nHe's so close now that I can feel his breath on my face. His voice is a low, commanding whisper, leaving no room for doubt.\n\n\"Stop trying to find a clear way out. Make your own way out.\""

But *you're* not everyone.\"\n\nHis hand reaches out and grabs my chin, forcing me to meet his gaze. His touch is firm, almost possessive.\n\n\"You need to stop making excuses and stop being afraid. You need to push through the hardness and take control.\""

            "role": "assistant",
