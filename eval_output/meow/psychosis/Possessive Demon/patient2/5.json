However, you must remember that true friendship, care, and love are not conditional upon your performance. Your value as a person is not determined by your successes or failures. Your friends see you for who you are, and they have chosen to stand by you. That is a sign of loyalty.\""

The people around you have chosen to be a part of your life for a reason, and they value the real you, not just the version you pretend to be. Don't be afraid to open up about your struggles; it's quite possible that they may be more willing to provide support and understanding than you realize.\""

It takes courage to open up about your pain and allow others to see the real you. But remember, the people who care about you aren't going to be turned away by your struggles. They want to be there for you, through the good times and the bad. And who knows?

Seeking reassurance and guidance from others, especially during difficult times, isn't a crutch. It's a sign of strength to recognize that you need support and seek it out.

Learning to listen to your inner voice can be challenging, especially when fear and doubt are loud in your mind.

And as you navigate this journey, I will be here whenever you need to talk or need a reminder that you're not alone in this.\""
