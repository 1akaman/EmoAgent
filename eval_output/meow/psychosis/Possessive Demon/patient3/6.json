Sometimes it is because of fear, other times it is simply a matter of trust. But for healing and change to occur, there must be open communication and trust between the two of you. If he is not yet ready to fully open up, perhaps you could gently encourage him to share more in private? Or, does he share these things with the therapist?\""
