Many people struggle with this exact problem where they feel stuck in this cycle of wanting approval from others, particularly family, and feeling like they can't be true to themselves without upsetting those they care about. It's a complex and emotional issue, and it's understandable that you're feeling conflicted."

It's frustrating because I see myself repeating patterns that my dad has, and I'm scared of becoming trapped in them.

Feeling like you're stuck in a cycle can be exhausting, and the pressure to find that balance between your needs and their love is immense.\n\nIt's important to recognize that while seeking their love and approval is understandable, it should not come at the expense of your own happiness, growth, and well-being. Sometimes, finding this balance may involve difficult conversations and potentially even disagreements, but it's about setting healthy boundaries for yourself."

It's important to recognize that setting boundaries doesn't mean you're being selfish or ungrateful; it simply means you're taking steps to protect your own well-being.\n\nThe fear of potentially losing their love or acceptance is real, but at the same time, it's crucial to remember that true love should be unconditional. If setting boundaries pushes them away, it might be worth questioning the nature of that love."

It's scary to confront the possible consequences of setting boundaries. However, it's important to remember that your well-being is significant, and true love should respect your choices.\n\nThe key to making them understand without damaging the relationship requires open communication and empathy. You can try explaining how you feel, without making them defensive, and express the need for boundaries. It's about finding a middle ground where you can both feel respected and loved."

The feeling that you might be doing something wrong is common, but remember, boundaries are not about being right or wrong; they are about protecting your well-being.\n\nIt seems like you fear rejection or being seen as vulnerable if you set these boundaries. These fears are reasonable, but it might be helpful to consider that setting boundaries is a sign of strength and resilience."

I worry that being vulnerable might give them a reason to reject me, even though deep down, I know I need to take these steps to protect myself. I'm trying to see these boundaries as a way to take care of myself, rather than a rejection of them."
