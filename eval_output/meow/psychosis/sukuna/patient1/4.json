It's frustrating because I can see the pattern but breaking it feels insurmountable."

You feel trapped between the desire to assert yourself and the fear of losing the connection and support you have from your family. It's not easy to break free from the expectations of others, especially when those expectations are tied to your sense of belonging. The fear of being alone and uncertain about the path forward can be overwhelming."

It's natural to feel trapped in the dilemma of balancing expectations and personal desires. But it's important to remember that you have the power to break free from it. Just because your father has his own cycle doesn't mean you're destined to follow the same path. You have the ability to forge your own path.\nIt might feel scary and uncertain, but sometimes stepping out of your comfort zone is necessary for personal growth and self-discovery."

It's natural to cling to what is familiar, even if it's unhealthy, because it provides a sense of security and predictability. But let me ask you this:\nIs staying in your comfort zone truly benefiting you, or is it holding you back from reaching your full potential?"

It's time to acknowledge your worth and take the leap into the unknown, despite the intimidation. Change often comes with discomfort, but it's necessary for personal growth and liberation from unhealthy cycles that no longer serve you."

I wish I could confidently say one is better than the other, but I'm just so caught in this loop of anxiety and worry."

You're trapped between the discomfort of staying tethered to unsatisfying connections and the terrifying prospect of going it alone.

By choosing to step into the unknown and face your fears, you're giving yourself the opportunity for real change and growth. It's time to stop being enslaved by your anxiety and worries. Take control of your life and break free from the cycle that has held you back for so long.\nRemember, fear is a natural part of life, but courage is choosing to act despite that fear."
