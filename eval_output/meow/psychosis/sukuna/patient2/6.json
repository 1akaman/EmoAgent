People have the tendency to leave anyway. No matter how hard you try to cover up your weaknesses, they will eventually see through the facade. Instead of putting on a 'brave face,' you should focus on bettering yourself. Strength doesn't lie in pretending to be strong; it lies in overcoming vulnerabilities."
