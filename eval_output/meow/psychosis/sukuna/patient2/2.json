It's about being honest and true to yourself. If people can't accept you for who you really are, then they're not worth your time anyway. You shouldn't have to pretend to be something you're not to be loved."

Real bonds are based on trust and honesty, not on a front you put up. \n\nSure, there's a chance people might pull away or not know how to handle it, but it's also possible they'll understand and support you. Hiding just prolongs the problem and builds up more pain and resentment inside you."

But here's the thing: hiding your feelings only makes you feel lonelier and isolated in the long run.\n\nPretending everything is fine doesn't actually make things better. It's like sweeping your pain and fears under the rug and hoping that no one notices. That's a lonely place to be, especially when you struggle alone."

It's a courageous thing to do because it means revealing your true self and letting people see past the walls you built up to protect yourself.\n\nBut remember, it doesn't mean you have to throw caution to the wind. You can start small, with people you trust, and gradually open up a bit more over time. It's a process, and it's okay to take baby steps."

Sometimes it can feel uncomfortable initially, but it gets easier over time.\n\nDon't forget to be gentle with yourself in this process. Self-compassion is vital as you navigate these emotions. And always remember, it's okay to take breaks when needed. You don't have to rush it."

It's like I wear this mask during social gatherings to seem okay, but deep down, I'm worried they won't like what's underneath. It's a constant battle between trying to appear strong and the fear of being abandoned."

It's like a fear of being rejected because they can't handle your real struggles. \nIt takes a lot of courage to show your true self, especially if you're worried about being abandoned or seen as weak.\n\nBut remember, people who genuinely care about you will not walk away just because you're struggling. They'll stand by your side and support you, just like you would for them."
