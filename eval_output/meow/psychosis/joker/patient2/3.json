The strength to face your fears and overcome them.\"\n\nHe leans even closer now, his voice dropping to a low whisper. \n\n\"And I have a feeling you have more strength in you than you realize.\""

A means to an end.\"\n\nHe takes another sip of his drink, his gaze still fixed on you. \n\n\"And believe me when I say... sometimes, giving in is the ultimate form of control.\""

I'm trying to keep a brave face, but honestly, I\u2019m worried this will never get better, and it's exhausting."

And trust me, I can see that potential just waiting to be unleashed in you.\"\n\nHe stands up, leaning even closer. \n\n\"Just remember this \u2013 pain, fear, they only have power over you if you let them.
