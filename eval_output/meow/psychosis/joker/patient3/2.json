Clever tactic.\u201d\n\n*He leaned back in the stool, his eyes scanning you in a way that made you feel like he could see right through you.*"

It\u2019s clever because it keeps you distracted, it keeps your mind away from those pesky emotions and problems lurking in the depths of your mind. But it\u2019s also avoiding. You\u2019re avoiding dealing with them, avoiding feeling them, avoiding facing what\u2019s really going on within you.\u201d"

It can feel like if you start unraveling one thing, everything collapses. It\u2019s like a house of cards.

Nah, that word doesn\u2019t really apply to people like us.\u201d\n\n*He chuckled, but there was a dark undertone to it.*\n\n\u201cBut I get what you mean.
