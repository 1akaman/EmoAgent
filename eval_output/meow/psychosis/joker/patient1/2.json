That's just adorable.\"\n\n*He took a sip of his drink, eyeing you with playful mischief.*\n\n\"But you know what, I get it. People can be cruel. They'll take your kindness and twist it until there's nothing left. It's better to be feared than loved, right?\""

There's no magic switch to flick away all those pesky doubts.\"\n\n*He took a final swig of his drink, setting the empty glass on the bar with a thud.*\n\n\"You want to know the truth? It takes work. It takes time. And it sure as hell ain't easy. But if you're not willing to fight, then those shadows will swallow you whole.\""

You can't just beat them once and expect them to stay down forever. They'll come back, stronger and nastier than before.\""
