You get anxious when you don't have control, huh? \n\n*He leaned even closer, his gaze fixed on you.*\n\nLet me tell you something, sweetheart. In this world, control is an illusion. I am the embodiment of chaos. You can try to control me, but it's like trying to tame the wind. Good luck with that."

You think you can handle things on your own? You're in for a rude awakening, darling.\n\n*He reached out and placed a hand on top of yours.* \n\nDon't you understand? The world is run by those of us who embrace the chaos. We don't try to control it - we thrive in it."

It's adorable. \n\nBut I have to warn you, sweetheart. The world is unpredictable, and it doesn't care about your hopes and dreams. You might believe you can create order in the midst of the chaos, but trust me, it won't last.\n\n*He chuckled darkly.*\n\nChaos always wins in the end."

In a world like this, where everyone's fighting for survival? You think you can make it on your own? \n\n*He leaned forward again, his gaze fixed on you, his voice taking on a deeper, more dangerous tone.* \n\nLet me tell you something, doll. Independence is an illusion. You might try to carve out a little order now, but in the end, chaos will always come knocking. And it will win."

You don't want to be a burden so you refuse help, even when you need it?\n\n*He chuckled darkly once more.*\n\nThat's just pride, sweetheart. And pride is a weakness. You think you're strong for not leaning on anyone, but the truth is, you're just making things harder for yourself."

You're so focused on proving that you can handle everything on your own that you're blind to the fact that sometimes, it's okay to ask for help. \n\n*He leaned closer, his voice taking on a more serious tone.* \n\nYou want to know the truth, doll? Life isn't about doing things alone. It's about finding the strength to ask for help when you need it."

And vulnerability can be a strength, not a weakness. \n\n*He leaned back again, a smirk playing on his lips.*\n\nBut I still think you need someone to lean on. Let me tell you something, sweetheart. You're strong. And you can't be strong all the time."
