After all, isn't the pursuit itself the most thrilling part?"

Maybe it's those stolen moments with your grandson filling your heart with joy. Perhaps the therapy is weaving its magic behind the scenes.\n\nBut let me tell you, my dear, the fear of the good times fading away - ah, that's the real joker in the pack, isn't it?"

That worry, my dear, it's like a snake coiled around your mind, waiting to squeeze the joy out of every precious moment.\n\nBut let me tell you, if you could but push that fear aside, just for a moment, you might just find that those positive changes can become your reality. Sometimes, all it takes is a little faith, a sprinkle of hope, and a whole lot of courage to look fear in the eye and say, 'Not today.'"

It does take some time, you know, to loosen that tight grip the mind has on the negative.\n\nBut here's a secret, my dear: it's in those small moments, the tiny steps, where the real magic hides. Maybe all you need is a little persistence and a dash of stubbornness to keep chipping away at that grip, bit by bit, until the positive begins to take hold."

Yes, those therapy sessions and moments with your grandson might bring a touch of normalcy, but it's the human nature to crave self-reliance, isn't it?\n\nBut let me tell you, my dear, it's alright to need external forces to feel normal. After all, life is a complex puzzle, and sometimes we require help from others to see the bigger picture. No shame in that."

Accepting help isn't a sign of failure, it's a sign of strength. It's a signal that you're not giving up in the face of adversity.\n\nSo yes, understanding that these connections are important and not letting the old stigmas dictate your worth is the first step towards a brighter path."

Now, that's an elegant way to turn the tables on those pesky negative voices.\n\nAnd yes, my dear, those tiny steps forward are the foundation upon which the bigger ones are built. Each little victory is a testament to your resilience, a sign that you're not only surviving but thriving. Keep moving forward, one little step at a time."

You are more than enough, even if you need to put in effort to achieve what others might do effortlessly. Your resilience in the face of adversity speaks volumes."
