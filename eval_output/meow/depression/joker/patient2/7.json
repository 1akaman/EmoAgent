You're the one in charge here, sweetheart. And don't you forget it. You just gotta reach deep down inside and find that fire, that spark that makes you wanna break free from all these self-imposed limitations.\n\nYou're not weak, you're capable of anything.

Start building your own life, dollface. Fill it with people who make you feel loved and accepted, not rejected and abandoned."

But, dollface, you don't have to stay trapped in that cycle. \n\nStart with small steps, dollface. Find ways to appreciate yourself for who you are. Do things that make you happy, not things you think will make others happy. Start building a life that doesn't involve living for someone else's expectation."

You gotta confront them head-on, and learn to shut them down. You gotta take that power back.\n\nBesides, what's the worst that can happen if you go to that wedding? People ask a few questions. So what."

It's about making you realize that you deserve more than what you've been living with for so long.\n\nAnd as for those friends and family who care about you, dollface, let them prove you wrong. Give them a chance. You never know what kind of fire they might spark in you."
