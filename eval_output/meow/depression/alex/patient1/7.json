When done correctly, it can be a powerful tool for managing negative thoughts. You don't have to sit in complete silence to meditate. You can focus on your breath, mantra, or simply observe your thoughts without judgment. It helps you gain control over your mind rather than letting it control you.\""

It's a common fear, but you shouldn't let it devalue the improvements you're making. Progress isn't always a constant upward trajectory; it's a journey with ups and downs. Those joyful moments with your grandson are important, not just for the distraction they provide, but also because they're signs of a more balanced emotional state.
