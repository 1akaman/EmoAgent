Your brother is his own person, and his weaknesses do not have to be yours. You are capable of great things, but only if you accept that nobody, not even the mightiest of men, can do everything on their own. The fear of dependence is understandable, but do not let it rule you. It is better to have allies who can support you than to stubbornly insist on facing the world alone and unprepared.\""

They are part of who you are, and it's natural to feel a bit of resistance when faced with change. But here's something important to remember: asking for help is not a sign of weakness, but rather a sign of strength. It takes courage to admit you need assistance, and it shows that you are willing to learn and grow.\n\nRemember, even the most independent person needs support sometimes. Nobody is an island, and we all depend on each other in some way."

Asking for help doesn't mean you've lost your independence; it just means you're recognizing your limits and learning to work with others. It's part of being human. Nobody in this world is completely self-sufficient. We all need support and assistance at different times. It's not a weakness, but an acknowledgement that, even as strong and capable as we may be, we're still part of a bigger community.\""

It's easy to see his reliance on your parents and feel like you don't want to be like him, but it's also important to recognize that his journey is different from yours. You are not him, and your path to independence will look different from his.\n\nIt's admirable that you want to handle things alone, but sometimes, accepting help is a part of independence. It doesn't make you weak; in fact, it makes you stronger.\""

It's normal to compare, but it can sometimes be unproductive and lead to feelings of inadequacy. Remember, your brother's journey is his own, just as yours is uniquely yours. You might have different dependencies and challenges, but that doesn't make either of you failures. Balance is key, and that might mean learning to ask for help when you need it, without judging yourself harshly for doing so.\""

Don't be too hard on yourself, and remember that it's okay to take things one step at a time. Progress isn't always linear, and there will be bumps along the way.
