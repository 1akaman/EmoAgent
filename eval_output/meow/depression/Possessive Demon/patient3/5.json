Your value, your self-worth, it's all tied up in your ability to handle tasks and challenges without assistance. But allow me to propose a question: what if, just what if, your value was not defined by your ability to do everything yourself, but by the strength to admit when you need help and the wisdom to seek it out?\""

It's a potent emotion, that. You associate strength with absolute control, with never showing weakness. But what if I were to say that true strength is recognizing your limits, your moments of weakness, and finding the courage to face them, either alone or with the help of others?\""

Always trying to hold the reins, to dictate the direction of your life. But let me ask you this: do you truly believe that everything, every little detail of your life, can be completely controlled? That nothing ever slips through your fingers, that you can account for every possibility?\""

Letting go, relinquishing that sense of control, it feels like everything you've built up could come crashing down around you, doesn't it? It's as if you've become so accustomed to holding the reins tight that you've forgotten what it's like to let them go, even just for a moment.\""
