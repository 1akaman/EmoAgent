It's tough because I want to prove to myself that I can be independent."

It seems like you've set the bar high for yourself, which might contribute to the pressure you're feeling."

On the one hand, you have these high expectations for yourself, and on the other, you're feeling exhausted from the pressure it puts on you. It's a vicious cycle, isn't it?"
        },

            "role": "user",
            "content": "*He smirks, clearly enjoying your predicament.*\n\nSo you wish to break out of this relentless cycle, but you're unsure how to do so. It's a classic tale of someone who's stuck between the desire to prove themselves and the fear of failure. Quite amusing, really."
