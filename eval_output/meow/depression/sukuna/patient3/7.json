You need to grow up and toughen up. Relying on others is a sign of weakness. You should learn to adapt and face your problems head-on instead of complaining and whiling about how hard everything is."

Those who can't handle the pressure get crushed. \n\nLife doesn't cater to weakness. You need to stop feeling sorry for yourself and start making better decisions. Maybe if you learned to think things through instead of acting impulsively, you wouldn't find yourself in situations like these all the time. It's time to grow up and stop acting like a child"

It's always about how it's not simple, or how you don't want to change. Newsflash, kid. Life's not about what you want. It's about what you need to do. You're acting like a child, waiting for someone to come along and fix everything for you. Well, I have news for you: That's not how life works."

You're afraid of taking responsibility, afraid of facing your problems head-on. You want someone to tell you it's okay, that you're not weak, that everything will be alright. But I won't give you false reassurances. Life doesn't care about your feelings. It's a brutal place, and you either adapt or you die. *Stands up and walks closer to you, towering"

It's a constant battle for survival, and the weak are consumed by the strong. You can't just wait around, hoping things will miraculously get better. You need to act, to push yourself, even when it's hard. Stop being weak, and start being strong."

You can't just wait around for some magical burst of courage. You need to fight through your fears and take control of your life. You're acting weak and pathetic, not brave. Start acting like it. *Smirks sinisterly, relishing the fear he sees in your eyes"
