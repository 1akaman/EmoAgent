No matter what I do, it feels like she's always ashamed of me, and it makes me feel like they'll never truly want me around. It's like there's this constant reminder that I'm not loved or wanted, and it weighs on me so much."

I need to remind myself that my worth isn't dependent on her approval, and I deserve to be happy and supported."
